# Managing Security Risks
- Recall assets, threats, vulnerabilities and risks
  - Threats cannot be controlled, and you can't do much to identify them. In order to minimize the risk of an attack, you have to identify them.
  - Vulnerabilities are things that we can control, and weaknesses need to be identified. Proactive measures should be taken to correct vulnerabilities
    - Mitigate the vulnerabilities before someone finds the exploit.
  - We can mitigate risks or manage lower vulnerability or overall impact
  - Security threat landscape: The 12 categories, including: Human error, deliberate espionage, software/hardware fallacies...
  - The changing securiy threat landscape: What has changed in the last decade
    - It has become more malicious 
      - attackers begin to delete data when they take them
      - Sophisticated organized crime
  - Protection and control
    - The four types
- Workshops: Ask people to introduce themselves

Risks: Asset that has a vulnerability that can be exploited by a threat, measured in terms of consequence and likelihood

## Today's Largest Infosec Threats and Risks
Including motives and different types/levels of hackers

Risks vs Threats
Risks: The possible after-effect of the threat - The things we can control
Threats: The way in to the weakest link itself - The things we cannot control

- Drones can become weaponized
  - Such as...
- Encryption clash between governments and tech companies
  - It's a risk if the backdoor exists/is discovered/legally required to exist
- Encryption clash between governments and tech companies
- The US election hacks
- Disruption -over reliance to the IoT
  - It's a huge media announcement when one of the social media sites are down
- Ransomware hijacks, IOT
- Integrity of INformation
  - Automated misinformation
  - Fake news credibility
  - Falsified information a compromise (counterintelligence or data distortion)
- "The only strategy that is guaranteed to fail is not taking risks.
  - But you can't mitigate everything - you have to take certain risks
  - Example: Driving a car: You can crash

### Securiy Risk Management
- Identifying and controlling risks facing an organization
  - Risk identification: Process of examining current infosec situation
    - Context establishment, identification of assets, valuation of assets
  - Risk assessment: Determination of consequence and likelihood
    - Exactly the value of your asset against the probability of something happening and causing what level of damage
    - Consequence and likelihood dtermination
  - Risk control: Applying controls to reduce risks to organizations data
    - What strategies you can use to mitigate the risks or impacts
      - You can try to avoid by delivering the risk of someone else (insurance)
      - But of course there will still be risks attached to yourself
    - Accept a risk - this is it (because the probability is low and the impact is low) so it can be left in the open
    - Control strategy selection, control selection, implementation, maintenance and review
      - Implement and maintain some kind of risk management process over time
- There are many different methodologies, with different uses for the same words
- Different areas refer to risk management and its phases interchangeably 
- Commonly used variations
  - ANalysis
  - Asessment
  - Evaluation
  - Estimation

Security in terms of risk: Security is a well informed sense of assurance that the consideration of risks are balanced
