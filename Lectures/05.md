# Digital Signatures
- "Mathematical link between a message and a public key"
- Sign through private keys, and verify through public keys
  - CAs issue some digital signatures on some public keys
- High entropy - any message will have different digests 
  - Fixed-length hash
  - Has to be computationally infeasible to find two messages that hash to the same digest
    - and that's why we need the hashes to be long
  - MD5 has got collision
- Example: H(m) = (m * a + b) mod c

```
(m * a + b) mod c = d
let k be any integer
k * c + d = m * a + b
m = (k * c + d - b)/a

With one m, we can try to calculate k (the hash) to get different messages 

Now suppose  a = 1 
What clashes with the 0 message?

- Both m = c and m = 0 
- First because everything falls through c as it is divided by c

```

- Structure of signatures is getting something a bit like RSA/DSA. Before being put into the algorithm, we hash it in a way that it won't have collisions
- Digital signing algorithm actually works in the digest itself
- If attackers can find two messages that hash to the same value, you'll get two different messages with the same signature
- Digital signature collisions makes good malware 
  - Flak malware: Mess with digital signature that comes from software updates
  - Found a hash collision in the certificate to attest a particular Microsoft public key
- It's critical to have hash functions where nobody can compute to the same value
- Signal's complicated protocol and fluff tries to deal with interception/MITM attacks

- Basic ways to agree in secrets
  - Diffie Hellman
    - Usually used with a new key 
    - Suspceptible to MITM
    - Have fresh values every time they communicate
  - RSA
    - If public key is fucked, so is everything else to the recipients/parties of the conversation
  - Both possible in SSL/TLS

- Desirable properties for secret messages
  - Resistance to MITM
  - Verify identity/public keys
  - Establish a shared secret 
  - Forward secrecy: Even if the attacker compromises your current key, past communications are secure
  - Future secrecy: When you're using a new key ach time (ephemeral keys), even if the attacker compromises your key now, the future stays secure 
  - That's why you have persistent secrets with friends and a bunch of changing keys (ephemeral)
- Ratcheting protocol
  - Combines Diffie-Hellman with longer term memory of the public key exchange when contacts first met
