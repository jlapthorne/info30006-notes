- Legislators don't really hear from governments or the lobbylists - such as for the argument on getting security backdoors
- When governments declassify, they don't read it. 
- When the US starts dominating the fiber and tech industry, the government is trying to find a way to get all the information within their borders, but from people within the US (section 702 of Prism)
    - Australia gets this data, and there are protection that Australians get from data tapped out
- The government *avoids* using actual technical terms.
    - This allows them changing what they do
    - "No more abouts, no more collection of something in the body of the email" - say things like things to avoid getting too specific so people can sniff it out
- So long as the handling of that data does not touch what they supposed to have, they can get away with what they do 
- The different committees have different infomration or knowledge of IT 
    - Otherwise, nobody knows what they're talking about
    - Even Californian representatives doesn't give a shit 
    - only a handful actually knows technical information, but they're stuck on commitees who can't make decisions
    - Hardly any expertees in the government staff - they don't know what they're doing.
- In the Senate, you can get access to any classified documents you can get, but on the House, there can be restrictions
    - e.g. Thin Thread: Program that limits what they were collecting. It's a lot cheaper than Prism or any other wiretap programs.
    - Contractors drive so many decisions in national security so governments are actually stuck with it
    - It's not just the privacy information, it's also the cost implications
- Law in US: Telecoms have to get a backdoor - but this hasn't been passed in tech companies
    - After 9/11, both were happily spying for the government, but by 2006, there were some exposure about it so people got a little squeamish
    - In 2009, part of Verizon backed up from the contract of the provisioning of private information
    - The USA Freedom Act was passed mostly because Verizon successfully withholded records that the government wanted
    - The government now gets to access information, but even less due to the passing of this act
    - The US can collect data offshore or by satellite as they're not bound by the law 
    - Now, they're going to try and get your IP and app messaging - but this law allows the government to ask for prospective/present record
    - There's no transparency of the full scope of the Act just yet
    - It's a game - they can collect a tremendous amount overseas or by SAT
    - There's a good reason to also believe that they're using it to surveil conversations of scientists too to extract scientific secrets
- There's laws for messaging apps to be able to give backdoors or metadata
    - Signal deliberately forces people onto stores to ensure there's contact numbers for the best messaging apps
    - "Going Dark" 
    - Senators asked how big of a problem this is, "we don't have the numbers"
    - One number they haven't been keeping is the amount of crimes it's tied on to
    - Up to no, 30% of our phones can't be broke into
    - Even of the Apple phones out there, the FBI can get in the majority of them
    - Android phones even much less
    - The first attack of Paris: The most important encryption in the attack was the HTTPS used to encrypt the transaction with Airbnb
        - OPSEC in these operations are very basic, but...
        - They speak dialects of Arabics with hardly any translators for
        - For the time the data came out, there are only 2 Halsa translators in the entire NSA
        - If you're not gonna fix the translation side, fix that before you break comms - it's the bigger issue than encryption
    - Stuff is sitting there not because of encryption, but because they can't read it
- Sucking up more data than just getting metadata
    - It's cheaper now to just hoard data
    - NSA can keep anything that is encrypted - and they do - until they can unlock it
    - We don't know how they tag it - but they have means to 
    - The NSA keeps as many data of that one encryption until there's enough to get it decrypted somehow - and the clock starts ticking when they can do something with it
- Snowden collected blank documents on his leaks 
    - At these reports, they were reviewing the security of the US intel agencies
    - Snowden in 2013 - omg, removable media - the systems aren't in place in all places since they declared to lock removable media access in government computers in 2008
    - NSA doesn't track removable media people or literally lock down their servers 
    - If you want to have all these capabilities, you have to keep them safe.
        - You don't keep them safe, you'll be the indirect cause of the global worms they developed themselves
- Regarding Apple's stand on privacy, even though it would cost them in a public image POV
    - Apple's business model: They want to move towards your phone being your life. 
    - Happened in the wake of some celebrities' phones
    - Wants to show the world on what happens if Apple doesn't double down on security
    - Technology is all about trust
    - People turn to macOS or iOS for the security
    - Apple is promising a walled garden - if you stay in Apple's environment, you get this walled garden
       - But are they really getting it secured through the app store?
- Would tech companies fight hard against placing backdoors in Australia?
    - Google and Apple would take the lead, and Facebook to some degree.
    - Facebook has a more awkward case 
    - What does it mean to give people their credentials back safely?
    - We have to talk more of the cost of having the big tech companies take charge of our data
- Google and Apple are mostly like shadows of
    - People get friend suggestions for having no connection whatsoever
    - Facebook does location pinning for friend requests since forever - it "was an experiment"
    - Facebook has a bad ethic of doing human experiments with no consent
    - Law enforcement is increasingly asking for location data from Facebook
    - There's rare public discussion of how they're doing this, but you should assume that these guys are always tagged
    - Of course it's natural to track them through Facebook
    - Under 702, NSA can spy on political parties
    - Google takes all your online identities and matching them
    - Google can give your primary phone number, and that number can be used to call your operator and get info of what you do
- Election hacking: Elements around invading people's private information - what has and what hasn't actually happened, and what opportunities there are
    - Registration of elections are not private
    - There are three parts: 
        - Stealing emails: Even under 702, the US spies on other political parties. NSA and CIA worked together to hack the smartphones of Mexican parties. The US does hack political entities to figure out what's going on.
            - In the US they word this differently as "weaponized data"
            - Allegation is that these emails were phished, so Russian agents can go in and cooperate. 
            - No one doubts it's the FSB, and another is observing (GRU)
        - Fake news: Sort of crazy; Russians took up stories and made conspiracy stories (Pizzagate), and would send these. Congress is now looking at whether using Facebook, Russians sent emails to depress people in states that would win for Trump
            - Keep an eye for Facebook reports for us. But only 0.1% of this malicious. The only way you get to this number is distinguishing Russians, Bernie voters, or reps
            - How do you distinct between new and old. 
            - Republicans have been doing this fake news really aggressively, but what distinguishes it is Russian involvement
            - Cambridge Analytica: A company that does population management, that took the idea of getting Facebook's phsychology data, and found ways to shut down turnout on women of color is Michigan
            - The debate is wheter the Russians or Republicans use American social media for propaganda
            - Facebook has incredible forensics of this stuff, tracking intelligences almost like intelligences themselves 
                - "our conclusions aren't as different as US intelligence agencies"
            - It's unclear if it's just people using Facebook to just find legit information of people or had something else
            - Facebook is closely tracking people who they claim claim are Russian bots - but that brings up the question of who's violent or not
            - Twitter: What speech gets policed
            - Facebook has global forensics to keep their network running and fairly civil (but nah)
            - Assume Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo have Australian intelligence level data,
            - There's little discussion of what happens if Russians can use Facebook's algorithms, but place the blame on Facebook
        - Tampering the tallying process: Not the machines themselves. It's harder because there's no national counting, so they'd have to hack 2500 sites, not to mention about the different counties or states. The easiest state to hack is Georgia, because they have paper ballots.
            - Russians were alleged to tamper with voter roles for identity theft. 
            - One of the ways Reps supress the vote is that the low frequency voters hasn't voted for three cycles - they must have moved, so strike them out. People who think they're registered to vote will turn up and turned down that they're not registered to vote
            - They'll pull targeted people off the roster, but allow it to add to the line waiting time. 
            - Political parties take this data and match it up with marketing data - apparently it's scientifically proven that someone driving an American pickup truck will vote for Trump 
                - So they can make it easier for those drivers to vote...
            - They sell these lists - very enhanced data
            - They found in an unprotected server of enhanced information of 190 million server, found through Shodan
                - Unenhanced data is purchasable, but the enhanced information is just sitting there somewhere
                - It was a Republican consultancy company
                - It was left there so pacts and parties can coordinate
    - The long story 
    - How you would hack an election
        - Politicians are all about analytics data
        - Hillary, being Hillary, did it to a fault. 
            - You have to do things to do x y and z to win a state
            - But Hillary ignored it
            - The Hillary blue backpack: She relies in analytics too much to ignore what's in front of them
            - Translates to her not campaigning within Michigan
        - Do it and mess with their analytics and monitoring
            - StacksNet: Hack of the Iranian nuclear program, to fuck up with the centrifuges and screw up their nuclear program
            - It also messes the visibility of their centrifuge process - hack all of that so that it looks normal
        - The easiest way of hacking things is to interrupt the feedback loop!
            - She doesn't know everything is screwing up if you hack the analytics program
            - The question is whether Hillary crosschecked her analytics
            - Poorer counties have worse equipment
                - The most important stuff you're doing is closing down the votes and you don't know how to handle computers 
                - So we don't know if that's a lot easier to perform in poorer counties
- How easy is it to hack US election machines?
    - How's the security of the very foundations of democracy? 
    - DIfference between not knowing the machine was hacked and knowing that the machines are not hacked
    - It's true that we don't know if they machines were hacked, but the systems were not designed to provide good evidence if anything happens
        - They're not transparent enough
        - For scan machines: If anything is wrong with the machine, there's still a paper trail you can assess. This is more favorable than the computers in most states because it's so bad
        - As far of technicalities are concerned, there's a long story of vulnerabilities in US elections
        - The best demonstration is the ripple effect
        - In California, they've once had election machines that they all found that they could stick something onto the machines and get a vulnerability
        - The really good attacks infect the machine, its tallying memory, and infect all the votes of the central tallying machine
            - And the better part is that these worms can stay around until the next election
    - Michigan and Pennslyvania has a large number of no-votes for presidents (twice the number than they ever had)
        - In fact, people were voting for the other parties other than Dem or Rep
        - There's a question whether machines registers the votes correctly
- In the DNC, 7 out of 9 mail boxes were already exposed
    - There's one mailbox that uses very easy password 
    - DON'T REUSE PASSWORDS
    - Widely agreed that FSB done a big campaign against US targets and was during the time Hillary's emails were being investigated
    - FBI already called them and notified them, but never responded
    - Only after March DNC responded
- The refusal to cooperate with whoever warns the victims are also a big question of trust.
    - Do we want Facebook to admit it was the Russians? Will this drive the people away?
    - You have to understand the methodology of tech companies 
    - It's a trust issue
    - What it demonstrates is Facebook's tremendous power
- Why won't encryption be illegal?
    - They can make it illegal, but they won't stop it
    - At some point in the First World, they'll realize there's an incentive to just get them secured, but they'll still have metadata
    - That data can be accessible to all governments easily
    - At some point, if they realize they have the good society using crypto, it's preferable for everyone overseas to run it properly
    - but the debate is fintech has their own secure comms - but they had to backdoor it by law
        - Question is: Do you want banking and finance to be known?
- Is there a way to make decision makers making good decisions?
    - The people who make decisions are by and large intelligence committees - and that's intoxicating
    - For most of them, they're intoxicated and believe the secrets are always true
    - Attitude of security about how stuff works and why gets supressed when we talk about crypto - but transparency about what happened, why and what went wrong is shunted in MILSEC, but it's an ordinary information
    - This attitude hasn't transfered across
