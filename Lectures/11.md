### Week 3 
- Risk 

# Okay here they are - Information Security 
- Infosec: Protecting information systems against misuse and interference from external parties 
  - It happens constantly that data, information and knowledge are leaked to competitors
  - Lack of focus on infosec and knowledge leakage 
  - "Building systems to remain dependable in the face of malice, error or mischance" - Ross Anderson
- Properties of a secure system
  - C Confidentiality
  - I Integrity
  - A Availability 
- Secrecy and Confidentiality
  - Secrecy 
    - Keep data hidden
  - Confidentiality
    - Keep someone else's data from unauthorized entities
  - Australian Privacy Principles 
    - Read this shit 
    - Familiarize yourself with this shit
- Privacy and Anonymity
  - Privacy
    - Use/disclose a person's data according to a set of rules
  - Anonymity
    - Keep identity of a protocol participant secret 
- Integrity
  - Ensure data is correct, prvenintg unauthorized or improper changes
- Authentication
  - Verify identity
  - Data authentication: Ensure that the data originates from claimed senders 

## Security through Obscurity
- There will be different frameworks for protecting knowledge 
- Security through obscurity: "You can't be attacked when people don't know you exist"
  - It requires a fair bit of knowledge of the software/infrastructe to attack it 
  - As little as you can reveal, the better it is 
  - Don't reveal more than you have to to the world 
- Why do we use this? 
  - Is it harder to a safe with the lights on or lights off?
  - Would it be easier if the breakers know the make and model of the safe?
  - What about their ability to see the numbers of the safe?
- Basically: "What is the least information is needed to get the job done?"
  - Obscurity doesn't mean intended misdirection 
  - May violate the principle that simple is more secure
  - It's nice to have honeypots but it's not always the intention with the saying 
  - Keep the simple principle in mind (,stupid.)

### Real World Security 
Boils down to the following

- Specification: What is the system supposed to do 
- Implementation/mechanism: How does it do it
- Correctness/assurance: Does it really work
- Human nature: Can the system survive clever users
- Other frameworks: NIST, Department of Energy/Department of Defense AU 

## Basic Security Analysis
How do we as organizations secure a system? Is that system secure?

- Who/what are we protecting
  - Enumerate information and knowledge assets and their value
  - Understand the system architecture and how it works
  - What is the operating value? How much will we lose if the resource dies?
  - What is the replacement cost? How long would it take to replace it?
  - What is the replacement cost if you lose it, and how long would it take to replace it?
- Who/what is the adversary/potential threat
  - What are their motivations? Who are they
  - Estimate their resources (time and money)
  - Estimate number of attackers and the probability of attack
- What are the security requirements
  - Confidentiality
  - Integrity
  - Authenticty
  - Availability
  - Auditability
  - Access control
  - Privacy
  - etc...
  - What were the concepts that we talked about in the tutorials - focus on the current events and the implications
- What security strategies are effective 
  - No security 
   - Legal protection
   - Innovative (patent attack)
  - Resilience to attack 
    - Multiple redundant systems
  - Detection, recovery and countermaneuvers
    - Introsuion detection system
    - Redundancy, backups, etc
    - Countermaneuvers? Legal measures?
  - Type of securiy strategies
    - Prevention
    - Deterrance
    - Surveillance
    - Detection and resposne
    - Perimeter defense
      - Get some fucking tanks out there 
    - Compartmentaliation
    - Layering
- Prevention
  - Passive
  - Not all measures are physical
  - Prevention is the hardest strategy to implement and often the most expensive
  - Experts can still find the target
- Detection
- Threat Models
- Think Like an attacker

They are used, but they are also adapted depending on companies, industries and data you are protecting

### Common Adversary
- Attacker action
  - Passive
  - Adctive
- Attacker sophistication
  - Script kiddies to government-funded organizations or professionals
- Attacker capability

## Knowledge Leak
*Carlos Agudelo, Unimelb*

Knowledge Leakage from mobile devices and social media. 

## Motivation
- We are now in the knowledge economy. Australian organizations are driving innovation and leveraging technology to generate products and services based on knowledge-intensive activites
- Each security incident in the business costs an average 2.8 mil
- Australian organizations spend the second most worldwide investigating and assessing breaches
- Emplouyees deliberately or inadvertently are the missing link 
- Culture and people with an organization are just likely to be the source of leakage

## Data vs Information vs Knowledge 
- You can know what to do, but it doesn't mean you know how to do it
  - Information vs Knowledge 
- Tacit knowledge: Not so easily expressed. highly personal, hard to formalize and difficult to comunicate to thers
- Explicit knowledge: Is formal and systematic. It can be easily communicated and shared
- Definition of knowledge
  - Documents, repos, designs, anything that gives contextual information that gives out a competitive advantage.
  - They take into configuration assets, computers, systems, people, organization culture


### Knowledge Cycle
- From data, to information, to knowledge
- Once knowledge has been made explicit into artefacts (iamges, text, audiovisual), it becomes information.
- In this research, it posits that it is possible to infer knowledge from information which can enable an unauthorized party to cause harm in the form of competitive advantage erosion, loss of reputation or financial/legal liabilities
- A lot of info is out there. With the recent big breaches, you can perform inference attacks from leaked information before with inforamtion that is just gotten elsewhere 
- More often than not, people disclose information thinking that they have particular sensitive aspects that documents can be safely disclosed
- If you have enough information, you have an advantage to pull different leaks 

## Knowledge Managers vs Security Managers
check slides 

- Knowledge and security aren't really connected concepts 
- Knowledge has different connotations. It can be an objet, a state of mind, a process, a capability, access to information

## Knowledge Leakage
- Intentional
  - Disclosure of knowledge
  - Copy of organizational sensitive content
- Unintentional 
  - Accidental emails to recipeints
  - Loss of staff
  - Outsourcing/joint ventures
  - Employee oversight
  - Poor business process
  - Risky behaviors
    - Posting confidential details on social media
    - Click on phishing emails URLs unwittingly and download attachments from unknown sources
    - Connecting to open WiFi networks
    - Selection of poor security controls or bypassing of controls
- Focuses on confidentiality out of the three

## Example Scenarios
- Data leakage
- Information leakage
- Knowledge leakage (human approach)
  - Knowledgeable employee leaves company for competitor
  - Knowledgeable conference, meetings, chats
  - Inference knowledge from real-world interactions as opposed to digital interactions 
  - Measures: Knowledge Protection, legal copyright, tacit knowledge, compartmentalization, disruption, misinformation, knowledge protection, policies

## Knowledge Leakage Risk
- Measure of the extent to which an organziation is threatened b a potential knowledge leak circumstance or event, and typically in a function of
  - Adverse impacts sthat would arise if the KL circumstance occurs, in dollars and 
  - Likelihood of the occurance

### Knowledge Leakage Framework
- Can be intentional or accidental leakage
- Can be tacit or explicit knowledge 
- check slides

- Explicit knowledge has different approaches in formal protection

## Human Factor - Personal Context
- Develop trust
- Use deterrents (punishments and sanctions)
- High risk person with high risk position
- User behavior analytics
  - This is still a breach of privacy`
- Gamification
- Education, training and awareness 
- Decoy campaigns
