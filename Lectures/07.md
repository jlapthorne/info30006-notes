# Digital Footprints and Privacy
- What is privacy?
- What is the impact of technology on privacy 
- How to defend end user privacy - good security and how they are intertwined
- Privacy
  - "Legal scholarship has conceputalized privacy as a form of protection for the liberal self"
  - "Shelters dynamic, emergent subjectivity from the efforts of commercial and government actors to render individuals and communities fixed, transparents and predictable"
  - Invasion of privacy can be "episodic or systemic"
  - Freedom for surveillance needed for an informed and reflective citizenship
  - Privacy has economic role in innovation, sheltering the process of play and experimentation from which innovation emerges
- Important concepts
  - It is very difficult to be actually anon
  - Anon and privacy are two different but related concepts
  - Privacy and security are two different things
     - But you need often need secuirty to have privacy
  - Laws are more often than not moving slowly than technology, but privacy and security does move faster
  - Anonymity and privacy need different tools; one is more difficult than the other target
  - Always assume that someone is listening, unless if you use really strong encryption
  - End points are the major point of weakness

## Metadata
- Your information footprint is not just what you post online. 
- Work habits identify us (cursor tracking)
- Metadata: Location, location, location data
- It's not just your phone/tablet/device
  - How do people tag you or mention you
  - Geo-tag nearby strangers 
  - Business and services: Transactions, how you use their services, credit card data, business strategies extracted from personal accounts
  - memes
- Example: *I Know Where your Cat Lives*
  - Locates their metadata by lat, lon

## Footprints
- No, you can't just turn off your phone
- The NSA's TAO unit
  - Tailored Access Operations
  - Exploits zero day vulnerabilities
  - Efficient, discrete attacks
  - Started when less than 2% of the world had internet
  - DROPOUTJEEP - software implant in the iPhone
    - Can push files from the device, gets contact list, voicemale, geolocation, hot mic, camera, cell tower, command, control and data exfil. All coms are covert and encrypted.
  - It's all possible.
- US Government spied on the AP back in 2013 
- Paul Farrell - depth of spying on journalists. 200 pages of police investigation files are of his metadata and records, purpose is to find his source.

## Privacy
- Practical ways to improve privacy
  - Check privacy settings and update them
  - Particularly on mobile apps, online accounts, other software 
  - Turn off settings that share information, such as location data and contacts that is unnecessary for the service/use
- This kind of simple advice is useful in personal and a business setting. For example, you may not want industry competitors knowing where sales reps are located if it's a client they are trying to steal away from the competitor
- It's very difficult to be truly anon
  - IP address is transmitted
  - Browser transmits info about `userAgentString`
  - Browser history
  - Cloud services don't really delete data
  - Case study: Paula Broadwell, Gen Petraeus 
    - Discovered by capture of Broadwell's IP address
    - convicted for access to classified information - didn't go to prison though
    - Paula hidden her identity trying to be anon, and has sent threatening emails to a Florida socialite
    - Former exec of FBI says her IP address was captured; they were using an online drop box to conceal email traffic. The other person goes and view the email but it's not actually sent.
      - Yaeh you are anonymous but your IP address is logged.
  - Data mining, facial recognition, activity modeling, speaker identification
  - Even the way you write can be used to calculate who you are.
    - Word pairings can help 
    - Character ingrams
    - Tallied the most common words and compared locations, meanings, frequencies
    - What fractions of the book were from lengths of letters
  - Governments can even tell you to not push anonymous texts or calls
  - Thailand: Special SIM cards that can be tracked by authorities. All operators must preset some features in SIM cards to always make sure they can always locate users, mandated by the government 

### Dealing with Anonymity
- Assume you have less anonymity when you're doing something electronically
- Only give out as much personal information as you have to
  - Don't give info
  - Give them made up information
  - Choose some other way of using it

### The Big Five Security Audit
- Patch
- Use strong passwords
- Encrypt data at rest
- Encrypt data in transit
- Enable mfa and OTP
- Optional
  - HTTPS Everywhere
  - VPN
