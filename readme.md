# Infosec and Privacy Notes

Because it's so much better to have a git repo than a massive Google Docs document that'll slow down anything that runs it with less than 2000 zillion GBs of RAM.

## How do I contribute?

You can either add notes directly into Markdown files in your own fork and then open a PR. If you're contributing a lot we'll just make you a contributor. You can also just add your own notes (resolving naming conflicts) into new files with preferably descriptive names. 

Feel free to do anything, really, as long as you're not removing things without consent. 

Perhaps leave it tidy so we can have it indexed by search engines for the next batch next year!
