# Presenting team
- documentary is mainly about mass surveillance
- Middle Easten countries employing mass surveillance in unprecedented levels: adverse effects
- use of oppressive government - “opposition”
	- silencing any activists (human right activitists)

## Mass surveillance
- not just general browser history, contacts, etc. but following individual people
- not owned by gov’t, but owned and sold by private institutions like BAE
- one of the biggest components of these system solutions: decryption
	- data that you’re sending - calls, browser history, location - encrypted
		- can be decrypted, exposing everything about you

## Neutral viewpoint
- mass surveillance to curb terrorist attacks and organised crime
	- put forward by spy organisations, companies
	- issue: most of the data isn’t free access
	- home office in the UK: mass surveillance is “insignificant” in counter-terrorism efforts
	- early warning system - but doesn’t actually get you very far
- philosophical: mass surveillance is just technology
	- depends on how you use it
	- e.g. chair, dynamite
		- dynamite for mining vs. as a bomb

### Arguments
- issue: we’re not aware of how many attacks are actually prevented by mass surveillance since the data is hidden for security reasons
- easy to use mass surveillance unlawfully
	- what happens when a criminal organisation gets hands on this technology?
		- e.g. steal cookies: pretend to be you
	- presumably the information from mass surveillance is stored somewhere - what happens when the data is leaked/compromised?
- mass surveillance is not inherently oppresive
	- non-oppresive countries don’t necessarily become oppressive because of mass surveillance; oppressive countries don’t necessarily become more oppressive or less oppressive
		- they will find a way to do it regardless
	- however, mass surveillance is still used for oppressive reasons
		- Ahmed Mansoor’s case (in the UAE)
		- Nabana Hanashi of Oman who was abducted and imprisoned for 30 days, and then 18 months
			- because he called out the Sultan of Oman’s power
			- had to flee the country, and set up initiative to track human rights in Oman
				- despite no one else knowing that information, they were being captured and arrested

## Adverse effects of mass surveillance
- breach of privacy:
	- phishing sites
	- location, microphone access give away all the things you do - clear breach of privacy
	- thus mass surveillance is problematic
- if you got nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear
	- extreme version of argument: why not put a security camera in your bedroom?
	- the issue is not “nothing to hide”
		- everyone has a bit of their life they prefer to keep private
		- different side of personality - e.g. interest group, etc. which someone doesn’t want to reveal to others
	- mass surveillance has the capacity to take that away from us
		- if every single aspect of our daily life is monitored (and controlled - implicitly)
			- if you’re being observed, you will act differently
				- especially if you can be arrested for your actions
	- other issue: how long the data is retained
		- metadata retention scheme
		- journalist example
			- put metadata online
			- security experts found out where he lived, where he worked, when he went overseas, where his girlfriend lived, his favourite bar just from metadata
- encryption puts into question the security of the web
	- bank accounts, conversations
	- encryption is at the foundation of web security
	- weak encryption: creates more and more vulnerabilities (also by other threat actors)

### Issues of mass surveillance
- “if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to be afraid of”
	- everyone has something to be afraid of
- there are always corrupt politicians in every gov’t
	- what can stop them from unlawfully using the data?
		- selling?
		- exploiting people using the data? (blackmail, etc?)
	- are there any circumstances under which someone should not be under surveillance?
		- politicans should not be under surveillance, because it prevents them from being blackmailed from other members
			- we can relate this to Hillary Clinton’s case
				- leaked emails, etc.
				- advantage to Donald Trump
			- agents
				- protect them from damages (?)
			- individuals in witness protection programs
				- protect their identity - they should be protected from surveillance
				- there is a case for having them surveilled for protection, but it should be in some other form instead of watching them by scanning their messages etc.

## Closing quote
- Yahya Ashiri (?)
	- she refers to mass surveillance as repression
	- youth see freedom etc. as crushed dream -> turn to extremism
	- should Western countries sell these technologies to companies in humanitarian crises?
