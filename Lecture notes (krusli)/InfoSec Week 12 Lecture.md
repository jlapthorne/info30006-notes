- 97 CPU days for 1024-bit RSA keys; 140.8 CPU years for 2048-bit keys
    - $40-$80, $20k-$40k

## Exam reminders, sample exam
### Reminders
- check date, time, venue on the day
- remember student card
- 15 minute Q&A (only comprehension questions/only Heidi present)
- 2 hours, plan time based on marks and types of questions
- provision of script book (write on right-hand side only!) and MCA sheet
- three parts (infosec, privacy, cryptography)
    - realise that these areas are interrelated
    - headlines provided: kind of a guide to remember where you learnt "this"
    - infosec will be the smallest part in terms of mark - focus much more on privacy and cryptography
        - imples privacy > crypto > InfoSec
        - InfoSec just a foundation to get comfortable on the exam
- read all questions with care: **what are we asking you to do?** (NB! which section is the question located under)
- answer all quesitons - a wrong answer will not cause deduction in marks
- time goes fast
    - 2h
    - easy in the beginning to ease into it
- there will be multiple choice question
- give us the answer and context: don't have time for that!
    - questions
    - have our own answers
    - answers can be flexible depending on the question
    - essay: list what we think you could be answering and would be right; 2 of 5 something
    - front page of the exam: ~~60 points~~ 50 points
    - 1:1 to question

## Sample exam
- reading time 15m
- writing time 120m

### Details
- 3 parts
- total of 50 marks
- mix of questions
- indicative
    - 3 parts
        - infosec: 10 marks
            - CIA triad represents fundamental secuvrity goals; describe 2 other security goals and briefly explain what they represent
            - 5 different types of security threats + example
            - conducting risk management exercises
                - what are project and business risks
                - processing of analysisn gidentified risks before you can respond w/ the proper response strategy
        - crypto and protcols: 25 marks
            - what is wrong with 512-bit RSA? Why was it mandated for what purpose, how long ago?
            - wrtie two desirable secrecy properties of a key exchange protocol, and write a sentence explaining what they mean
            - you are a manager in an organisation and are explaining to a staff member why and how to use Signal. Briefly justify why they should use Signal, and at least one important applied security feature
            - question for privacy within crypto/protocols
                - location of question *may* help you find an answer; but it may not
        - privacy: 15 marks
            - something on Australian privacy principles
            - read 11-page fact sheet, get acquainted with it
                - blood donation
                - Readings Online
            - may or may not ask the same questions

## Other
- questions derived from tutorials?
    - they could be; yeah
    - tutorials are based on what you learn in class, but it's an extension where we ask you to reflect on something: take it a step further
    - could be something
    - not nitty-gritty details; something you will be able to answer in general if you've been to the tutorial
    - tutorial might help you in terms of the exact case and the extra arguments/justifications you might add
- readings referred to from the tutorial
    - I would say yes
    - Vanessa's tutorial on crypto
        - keys under doormat
        - encryption: BobAlice - read that because that was a workshop remember AFAIK; key for you understanding the whole concept of cryptography
    - cases in other workshop: nothing specific from those
- dot points vs. long sentences
    - depends on the question
    - e.g. first one: describe  2 other security goals briefly explain what they represent
- email for answers: not provided; "too much help"
- justify/explain: make an argument
    - while describe: recall what has been mentioned
    - don't put too much effort into questions that don't give a lot of marks in return
    - 5/6 marks avg per question: not asking for essays/long answers; but do have the arguments in your head
- MCQ: tricky because of definitional differences
    - be aware you read the exact question; make sure it is what we are asking
- questions relying on real-world cases: I don't think so; not going to give you questions that give you many marks
    - for your own sake, when you answer these questions, do have a case on the back of your head
    - e.g. crypto: what did Sulette/Vanessa use as an exmample for e.g. public/private keys
        - Alice/Bob
        - don't worry about the math behind it (no calculator)
    - maths questions taken out: no calculator
    - tried to really adapt it to the circumstances
        - don't want you to remember equations/learn by memory a definition of something; think and understand the connections

## Overall assessment
- 1st workshop with Jebb: how we are going to assess presentation, facilitation and participation
    - opposed to marking structure (Heidi)
    - not going to be very strict - not planning on failing you
    - looking at differences between students - look at who participated
        - not just as talking
    - Jebb has the overview of "did X contribute to the discussion? when X said something"
    - problems w/ facilitating: facilitating the group's discussion and not providing answers
        - biggest problem in the workshops
- assignment: already looked at some of them
    - generally quite impressed - since cut it down in sizxe
    - hard to write a coherent piece of work
-
