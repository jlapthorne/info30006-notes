# Differential privacy
- 2 databases in R<sup>n x d</sup> *neighbour* if they differ by one row
  - "differ only by one person"
  - worst thing one can do is figure out if one person is in the database or not
- a *mechanism* is a random function on a DB
  - adding noise to the database
- mechanism M has ß-differential privacy (Dwork et al. 06)
  - if for every 2 neighbouring DBs D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub>, the distributions of M(D<sub>1</sub>) and M(D<sub>2</sub>) are close
- privacy loss = ratio between the 2 probabilities
  - likelihood when you get a 1 when the truthful answer is a 1 / when you get a 1 when the truthful answer is a 0
- for all possible answers along the graph, the privacy loss (likelihood of the answer) is <= ß
  - for that specific individual
