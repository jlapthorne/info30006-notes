# InfoSec practice exam
## Part I: InfoSec
### Q1
- authenticity
  - vs. non-repudiation:
    - authentication is a technical concept; non-repudiation is a legal concept
  - authenticity: one party (e.g. Alice), interacting with another (e.g. Bob) to convince Bob that some data really comes from Alice
  - e.g. SSL/TLS: provides authenticity (client is sure to talk with the intended server)
- non-repudiation
  - proving that some party did something
  - e.g. SSL/TLS: does not provide
    - client cannot record the session and show it as proof, in case of a legal dispute with the server because it will be easy to fake a session record
- accountability
  - ability to trace back actions to a specific entity (e.g. user, process, device)
- reliability
  - https://technology.berkeley.edu/archive/security#reliability5
  - reliability of the information store/service
  - do you have backups? funding? network infra? security? physical environment for information and services?

### Q2 - security threats (5) + example
- human error
- compromises to IP, e.g. piracy, copyright infringement,
- deliberate acts of:
  - espionage/trespass, e.g. unauthorized access and/or data collection
  - information extortion, e.g. blackmail with threat of disclosing information
  - sabotage/vandalism - from petty vandalism for "hacktivism" to more serious threats such as cybercriminals and nation states
  - theft: stealing physical/electronic/IP
  - software attacks - malicious SW
- forces of nature
- quality of service - deviations from service providers
- HW failures/errors
- SW failures/errors
- technological obsolescence

### Q3: risk management exercise - 10 risks classified as project and business risks
#### a) Define project and business risks
- https://thinkingportfolio.com/project-risks-vs-business-risks/
- business risk: impact - on business
  - anything that has the potential of threatening the generation of profit (according to targets)
  - could be quite dangerous for the long-term sustainability of the business
  - more general - impact on nearly all aspects
- project risks: impact - on single/several project
  - uncertain condition/event that may affect one or more project objectives

#### b) Describe the processing of analysing the identified risks before you can respond with the proper response strategy
