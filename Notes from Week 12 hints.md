# Hints
## Relationship between InfoSec, privacy and cryptography (also in lecture 2, see below)
- mindmap, understand definitions, show how the overall construct and sub-constructs relate to each other
- information security: multidisciplinary area of study and professional activity which aims to protect business by reducing risks associated with information and information systems by means of a comprehensive and systematic management of security countermeasures, which is driven by risk analysis and cost-effectiveness.
  - Cherdantseva and Hilton (2014)
- privacy:
  - dictionary: freedom from damaging publicity, public scrutiny, secret surveillance, or **unauthorised disclosure of one's personal data or information**, as by a government, coproration, or individual
  - Cohen
    - "legal scholarship has conceptualised privacy as a form of protection for the liberal self"
    - "privacy shelters dynamic, emergent subjectivity from the efforts of commercial and government actors to render individuals and communities fixed, transparent and predictable"
    - invasion of privacy can be "episodic or systemic"
    - "freedom from surveillance" is needed for "an informed and reflective citizenship"
    - privacy has an economic role in innovation - it "shelters the processes of play and experimentation from which innovation emerges"
  - lecture on Digital Footprints and Privacy
- cryptography: "art of writing and solving codes"
  - lecture on intro to cryptographic protocols
    - sending messages that are secret from everyone but the intended recipient
    - sender has to "hide" the message for sending so nobody else can understand it: encryption
    - decryption: "un-hiding" and recovering the message
- mindmap
- InfoSec: big picture
  - threats
  - risks
  - vulnerabilities
- cryptography: technology used to enable privacy (and even anonymity)
- privacy: freedom from having personal details/information/activities surveilled/disclosed
  - personal **information** - secured by InfoSec
  - cryptography is a technology that supports privacy

## The What, Why, When, Who, Where
### Why is InfoSec important?
- lecture 2
- legal reasons: APP (Australian Privacy Principles)
- business reasons - having an information asset compromised/disclosed can lead to monetary losses which pose a serious risk to the business
  - also no one will want to do business with a business they do not trust

### What does InfoSec encompass?
- lecture 2
  - InfoSec is about defending information: preventing unauthorised access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, inspection, recording or destruction of information
  - privacy: safeguarding personal data and protecting a personal image through e.g. encryption/decryption of data
    - objective: safeguarding personal data - i.e. data about individuals
    - why?
      - various legal, regulatory, political, and technological issues surrounding the issue of data privacy
  - cryptograhy: enables secure information transactions by encryption/decryption of data

### What are we trying to protect?
- asset: people, property, information

### How do we protect?
- using InfoSec controls
  - risk (management)
  - policy
  - strategy
  - SETA: security education, training and awareness

#### Risk management
- selecting controls to manage the risk
  - depends on the level of security risk exposure
  - how?
    - risk identification -> assessment -> response -> review/control

#### InfoSec policy
- security policy: plan/course of action that conveys instructions from an orgnaisation's senior management to those who make decisions, take actions, and perform other duties
  - "policy" - can be strategic-level, or operational-level
  - also called "practices" or "procedures"
