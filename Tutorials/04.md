# Workshop 5 
- "Putting the key under the doormat"
  - Exception access
  - Give second keys on chat applications
  - If the key is compromised, all data is compromised 
  - It goes beyond the best practices of authentication and confidentiality 
- Some devices are encrypted by default, but there's a problem when you want to reset/change your password (deencrypt and encrypt again)
  - People start using random key and use user key to encrpt random key
  - If some law enforcement agency want to get in, they can just encrypt the random key again 
  - Manufacturers can probably decrypt things without you knowing
  - Law enforcement can actually decrypt things without a warrant
- Risks - security development will be undermined and reversed
  - Giving the access to law enforcement compromises all your data for malicious users anyway
  - Government with access to data allow hackers to use the data if intercepted
  - Wiretapping is possible
  - Tradeoff - you can't guarantee access without some serious risks being pushed
- Adding complexity can lead to flaws
  - Can compromise access
  - Broader implications
    - Businesses
    - Personal
    - Government
  - Security risks can lead to loss of leadership
    - Consumers going to other companies outside the western economy for something else
- Security impacts
  - Access to communications content
    - Central database - central provider
    - Tap the communication
      - If communication is encrypted, the session key should be encrypted by public keys of the police on both x and y
      - Or trusted third parties 
    - Escrow requirements reqstricts
      - Forward secrecy
      - Transient identities
      - Strong location privacy
    - Global nature of internet services
      - Buy services from countries that don't cooperate
      - IP geolocation allows attacks using location spoofing
    - Firms that do not provide excpetional access, leading to issues around certification and enforcement
      - Blocking at national level?
      - Crime to use app?
      - Effect of innovation
  - Access to communication data
    - Call records, location
    - Aim 
      - Aid crime investigation
    - Challenge
      - Cost of innovation to do so
      - Determining location (the easy part)
    - If you give the key, how do you know they're not gonna do anything stupid?
    - How is it different from dropping a bug in your home?
      - Undermines trust
      - Vendors will become more resisting
