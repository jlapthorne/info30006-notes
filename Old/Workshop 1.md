## Information security
- practice of preventing unauthorised access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, inspection, recording or destruction of information
- what does information refer to?
	- data/information/knowledge may take any form, e.g. digital or physical
	- security goals may include confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA), privacy, authenticity and trustworthiness, non-repudiation, accountablity and auditability
		- accountability: information can be traced back to you
		- audit: can trace backwards where something comes from; check the status of something based on a standard
		- Cherdanseva and Hilton, 2014 
	- knowledge: something we are consciously aware of, something we want to protect - it has value
		- information in memory with understanding and the relationships between these pieces of memory
		- we distinguish between data, knowledge and information, but when we talk about it we often mean all when we say one
		- this subject is in privacy in terms of businesses, consumers, and as citizens in society
		- privacy: secrecy applied to information
			- relationship: privacy is this, but in the context of individuals
- reading on the LMS on the background of information security and privacy

## Privacy
- For individual consumers and users of technology, information security has a significant effect on privacy
- Privacy is the *ability of an individual or group to seclude information about themselves to express themselves selectively*
- the boundaries and content of what is considered private differ among individual consumers/users
- main motivation
	- image control: people want to be able to control the image of themselves seen by other people
		- information that can disadvantage people if other people know said information
- what does it mean that something is “private” to someone?

## Cryptography
- encryption: transforming usable information into a form that renders it unusable by anyone other than an authorised user
- encrypted information can be transformed back to its original usable form by an authorised user who possesses the cryptographic key through the process of decryption
- E2E encryption, how much of your life can be inferred from telco metadata, and why “de-identified” data often is not
